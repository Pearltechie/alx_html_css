# Responsive Web Page Design

This README provides instructions and details about the responsive web page design, including its key features, setup, and usage.

## Project Description
This project is a responsive web page designed with the following features:
- A logo positioned at the top-left corner of the header.
- Navigation links and a button with hover/active effects.
- A maximum content width of 1000px, centered on the page.
- A mobile version that activates when the screen width is 480px or less.

The project is implemented using HTML and CSS, focusing on responsiveness and user experience.

## Key Features
1. **Responsive Layout**:
   - The web page automatically adjusts to smaller screen sizes (480px or less) using CSS media queries.

2. **Hover and Active Effects**:
   - Links change color to `#FF6565` on hover or when active.
   - The button reduces its opacity to `0.9` on hover or when active.

3. **Centered Content**:
   - The main content is constrained to a maximum width of 1000px and is centered horizontally on the page.

4. **Mobile-Friendly Design**:
   - Navigation links stack vertically.
   - Buttons take full width for better usability.
